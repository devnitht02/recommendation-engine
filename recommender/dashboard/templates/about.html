      <p class="text-gray-700 text-base text-justify leading-relaxed">
        Many students, particularly in rural areas, complete school without adequate guidance on what comes next.
        This platform was born from the realization that access to relevant, reliable, and personalized information
        can transform futures. We bridge the gap between potential and opportunity â€” one student at a time.
